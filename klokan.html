                <p>This software project was done at <a href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en">Charles University</a> as part of C# and C++ programming courses. Source code, Windows binaries and user documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/honzukka/Klokan">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Mathematical Kangaroo is an international competition for students of primary and secondary schools. Each student answers 24 questions by choosing one out of five possible answers. Answers sheets then have to be manually evaluated and the final score is assigned to each student. This process, however, is tedious and prone to human error.</p>

                <p>Klokan is an automated evaluation tool which processes images of scanned answer sheets and saves the results into a database where they can be queried or exported into Excel. It can therefore help make the evaluation of answer sheets easier in the meantime before the whole competition is digitized.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3 text-left"><i>The figure above shows what Klokan can do. It takes a scan of the answer sheet (in the middle of the figure) and extracts the student number and the answers out of it. Then it compares the answers to the correct ones that were manually entered by the user and computes the score. All this information is saved in a database and can be exported to Excel for further processing. In case the program doesn't extract the answers correctly, it is possible to make manual corrections. It is also possible to edit the parameters of the image processing algorithm and evaluate its performance in the Test module. Click on the image to view the original.</i></p>
